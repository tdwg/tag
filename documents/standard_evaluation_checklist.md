# Draft checklist for evaluating proposed standards

## 1 Documents
- Does the document identify what content is normative? (If there is no normative content, the document probably shouldn't officially be included in the standard.)
- Does the document use RFC 2119 keywords? If not, should it? If so, is the RFC 2119 statement present in the first section?
