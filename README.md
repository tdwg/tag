# TDWG Technical Architecture Group (`TAG`)

The Technical Architecture Group is a Functional Subcommittee (FS) of the TDWG Executive - responsible for ensuring that TDWG standards work effectively with each other, as well as with standards used more widely in natural and information sciences.  This is done primarily by giving technical advice to the Executive Committee, as well as Interest and Task Groups, as requested and through the review of Interest and Task Group charters, reports, and draft standards.
